Challenge: Make a class that allows INSERTS, UPDATES, DELETES and does SELECTS by calling a method. 
Create an instance of the class and make a method. Abstract the 'myConnectionString'. Then all that needs to happen is to send in
the query, ex: 'string myQuery= "spUdpateUser" and the parameters ex: SqlParameter[]...

Then create a class for each table. Ex: User table - class that UPDATES users, INSERTS users, retrieve or get specific user or check the password.

Start by creating 1 class for Users that generically does all the updates, inserts, deletes etc...
